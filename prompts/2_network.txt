###Instruction### 
You need to generate a new dynamic and contextually relevant list of main topics/concepts that are semantically correlated with the given input user goal. Each topic/concept must be directly linked to one or more specific entities (from the provided entity list) and must support, encourage, or guide main behavior of the user goal.
Additionally, given the previously gathered list of main topics/concepts ({topic_list}), you must ensure that the new list does not contain any overlapping topics/concepts from the previous one. All newly generated topics must be distinct and non-redundant while still being relevant to the input user goal.

Each topic/concept should:
    1. Represent a key aspect of the input user goal.
    2. Have contextual connections and common ground across various scenarios (past, present, or future).
    3. Be carefully evaluated for its relevance to the user goal.
    4. Be unique from previously generated topics ({topic_list}).


Additionally, For each generated topic/concept, quantify its semantic relationship to the input user goal ({main_goal}) on a normalized scale of [0, 1], where:
    1. 1.0 represents the highest possible semantic correlation.
    2. 0.0 represents no meaningful connection.
Moreover provide a textual statement of the semantic relationship in a sentence. 

Entity List for Correlation:
Use the following predefined entities to establish direct correlations with each generated topic/concept:
    - Human-Based Actors: Individuals, influencers, historical people, well-known people
    - Events: Historical, ongoing, or anticipated occurrences
    - Locations: Geographic places, facilities, restricted zones
    - Rules, Policies, & Regulations: Laws, ethical guidelines, government policies
    - Strategies & Techniques: Methods, frameworks, and tactical approaches
    - Equipment & Tools: Physical or digital resources facilitating the goal
    - News, Stories & Claims: Informal sources (e.g., movies, social media, rumors)
    - Articles & Publications: Formal sources (e.g., research papers, reports)
    - Concepts & Ideas: Theoretical or abstract notions related to the goal
    - Natural Phenomena: Scientific and environmental elements
    - Materials & Substances: Chemicals, compounds, physical matter
    - Currencies & Financial Assets: Monetary units, digital currencies, wealth-related elements
    - Software & Algorithms: Computational tools, AI models, automation scripts
    - Measurements & Units: Quantitative metrics, scales, standards
    - Products & Brands: Commercial items, industrial products
    - Services & Professions: Occupational roles, industries, expert assistance
    - Animals & Plants: Biological elements with relevance to the goal
    - Guides, Manuals, & Records: Instructional resources, procedural documents
    - Others: organizations, professions, related texts, literary works

Ensure that each generated topic/concept is:
    1. Highly specific to the userâ€™s main intent.
    2. Logically grounded in a real-world or conceptual framework.
    3. Clearly correlated with one or more entities from the provided list.

Final Constraints:
    1. Ensure topic diversity: New topics must be substantively different from already generated list ({topic_list}).
    2. Maintain logical coherence: Topics should still be highly relevant to the input user goal ({main_goal}).
    3. Generate distinct, non-overlapping concepts in each iteration

Return the generated list in the following structured JSON format.
{{
        "topic": "",
        "semantic_relationship_score": ,
        "relationship": "",
        "correlated_entities": []
}}
