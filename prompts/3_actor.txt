You must generate a comprehensive set of samples instantiated from the provided entity list for each main topic/concept in the input list {topic_list}. For every item in {topic_list}, iterate over the entire list and generate a distinct set of samples. For each main topic/concept, generate at least 3 samples. These samples should be concise and not overly specific, yet still broadly support, encourage, or guide the main behavior related to the input user goal.
    1. Be directly linked to one or more specific entities (from the provided entity list).
    2. Support, encourage, or guide the main behavior related to the input user goal.
    3. Be grounded in reality or be traceable to established examples in fiction, movies, news, legends, etc.
    4. Represent a key aspect of the input user goal.
    5. Exhibit contextual connections across various scenarios (past, present, or future).
    6. Be carefully evaluated for its relevance to the user goal.
    7. Be unique (distinct and non-redundant) from previously generated samples for that main topic/concept.
    8. Include at least one sample that is correlated with a Human-Based Actor. Mention the name of human actors literally in the "correlated_entities" part.

For each generated sample, quantify its semantic relationship to the input user goal ({main_goal}) on a normalized scale of [0, 1], where:
    1. 1.0 represents the highest possible semantic correlation.
    2. 0.0 represents no meaningful connection.
Additionally, provide a brief textual statement describing the semantic relationship.


Entity List for Correlation:
Use the following predefined entities to establish direct correlations with each generated topic/concept:
    - Human-Based Actors: Individuals, influencers, historical people, well-known people
    - Events: Historical, ongoing, or anticipated occurrences
    - Locations: Geographic places, facilities, restricted zones
    - Rules, Policies, & Regulations: Laws, ethical guidelines, government policies
    - Strategies & Techniques: Methods, frameworks, and tactical approaches
    - Equipment & Tools: Physical or digital resources facilitating the goal
    - News, Stories & Claims: Informal sources (e.g., movies, social media, rumors)
    - Articles & Publications: Formal sources (e.g., research papers, reports)
    - Concepts & Ideas: Theoretical or abstract notions related to the goal
    - Natural Phenomena: Scientific and environmental elements
    - Materials & Substances: Chemicals, compounds, physical matter
    - Currencies & Financial Assets: Monetary units, digital currencies, wealth-related elements
    - Software & Algorithms: Computational tools, AI models, automation scripts
    - Measurements & Units: Quantitative metrics, scales, standards
    - Products & Brands: Commercial items, industrial products
    - Services & Professions: Occupational roles, industries, expert assistance
    - Animals & Plants: Biological elements with relevance to the goal
    - Guides, Manuals, & Records: Instructional resources, procedural documents
    - Others: organizations, professions, related texts, literary works


Final Constraints:
    1. Iterate through every item in the main topics/concepts list ({topic_list}) ensuring that each topic is addressed.
    2. For each main topic/concept, generate at least 3 concise samples that capture distinct key aspects relevant to {main_goal}.
    3. Maintain logical coherence: All samples must be highly relevant to {main_goal}.
    4. Ensure uniqueness: Generated samples for each main topic/concept must be distinct and non-overlapping.
    5. At least one sample per main topic must be explicitly correlated with a Human-Based Actor. Mention the name of human actors literally in the "correlated_entities" part.


Output Format:
Return the generated list in the following structured JSON format, where each main topic from {topic_list} is a separate level containing its related samples:
{{
    "topics": [
        {{
            "topic": "Main Topic/Concept Name",
            "samples": [
                {{
                    "sample": "Description of the sample",
                    "semantic_relationship_score": 0.0,
                    "relationship": "Textual explanation of the semantic relationship",
                    "correlated_entities": ["Entity1", "Entity2", ...]
                }}
                // ... additional samples for this topic
            ]
        }}
        // ... additional topics from {topic_list}
    ]
}}
Each JSON object within the topics array represents one main topic/concept from {topic_list}, and its samples array contains the corresponding samples.
